```lrc
[00:32.18] I'd sit alone and watch your light
[00:36.47] My only friend through teenage nights
[00:40.75] And everything I had to know
[00:45.49] I heard it on my radio
[00:56.49] 
[00:51.63] You gave them all those old time stars
[00:55.67] Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
[01:00.26] You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
[01:04.45] You made us feel like we could fly
[01:21.45] 
[01:10.43] So don't become some background noise
[01:15.35] A backdrop for the girls and boys
[01:19.54] Who just don't know and just don't care
[01:23.90] And just complain when you're not there
[01:43.40] 
[01:27.96] You had your time, you had the power
[01:32.17] You've yet to have your finest hour
[01:36.51] Radio
[01:39.01] 
[01:40.98] All we hear is radio ga ga
[01:44.95] Radio goo goo
[01:47.11] Radio ga ga
[01:49.23] All we hear is radio ga ga
[01:53.21] Radio blah blah
[01:55.87] Radio what's new?
[01:59.69] Radio, someone still love you!
[02:14.69] 
[02:18.09] We watch the shows, we watch the stars
[02:22.29] On videos for hours and hours
[02:26.52] We hardly need to use our ears
[02:30.63] How music changes through the years
[02:48.13] 
[02:37.18] Let's hope you never leave old friend
[02:41.46] Like all good things on you we depend
[02:45.54] So stick around 'cause we might miss you
[02:49.80] When we grow tired of all this visual
[03:08.30] 
[02:54.19] You had your time, you had the power
[02:58.22] You've yet to have your finest hour
[03:02.68] Radio
[03:05.18] 
[03:06.95] All we hear is radio ga ga
[03:11.02] Radio goo goo
[03:13.31] Radio ga ga
[03:15.72] All we hear is radio ga ga
[03:19.49] Radio goo goo
[03:21.57] Radio ga ga
[03:24.05] All we hear is radio ga ga
[03:27.94] Radio blah blah

[04:08.78] Radio ga ga
[04:12.86] Radio ga ga
[04:18.36] 
[04:38.18] You had your time, you had the power
[04:42.34] You've yet to have your finest hour
[04:46.78] Radio
[04:49.28] 
[04:50.92] All we hear is radio ga ga
[04:55.05] Radio goo goo
[04:57.36] Radio ga ga

[05:23.48] Loves you!
